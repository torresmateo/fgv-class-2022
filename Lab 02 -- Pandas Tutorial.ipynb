    "# Pandas Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab session, we'll go through some useful ways to use [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data science. As is the case with the previous tutorial, this is NOT a comprehensive Pandas tutorial, but rather a collection of tips and useful fucntions that I expect you to use for the labs, exams, and courseworks of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is a self-paced tutorial, but make sure to take some time on this week to get familiar with the concepts.\n",
    "* If you find any part of this tutorial complicated, please prepare a list of questions for the beginning of the next lab.\n",
    "* The usual: the canonical answer to any of you questions is probably contained in the [Pandas User Guide](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html) and [Documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)\n",
    "* Similar to NumPy, Pandas is one of the essential tools for data science with Python, and if you're serious about data science as a career, you should take as long as you need to become proficient with the tool. I believe the best place to start is the [10 minutes to pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html) tutorial.\n",
